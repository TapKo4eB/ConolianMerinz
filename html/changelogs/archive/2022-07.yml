  Geevies:
  - code_imp: Xenos now check for death on updatehealth, meaning they die when you
      shoot them.
  Morrow:
  - bugfix: You can now quickdraw via holster/unholster key weapons held in the command
      pouch.
  Stan_Albatross, Nauticall.:

  - qol: Repairing vehicles and vehicle modules was reworked to be more convenient.

  - balance: buffed the synth tools vendor compact defibrillator from storing 7 to
      10 charges maximum.
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Special ERT roles now have (5 hour) timelocks, the standard squaddie role
      for each ERT doesn't, so no one is prohibited from joining, just from getting
      special roles.
  - rscadd: Where ERTs previously had a probability to get either two SGs, one SG
      one spec, two specs, they will now always get one SG, one spec.

      equipment roles.

  - rscadd: Applying vehicle clamp is no longer a timed action.
  - rscadd: Only vehicles of your faction can be clamped.

      of other factions.
  - bugfix: Fitting pulled mobs or objects into vehicle does actually check for access
      now if doors are locked.
  - bugfix: Fixed and improved vehicle scanning with Motion Detectors. MDs description
      now mentions this feature. Takes 3 seconds, shows humanoid and xenos signatures
      separately. It is by no means intended to be precise. Caution is advised.
  - rscadd: Vehicles now spawn unlocked.
  - code_imp: Added proper delay for vehicles with broken or without wheels or tracks
      and delay should apply instantly upon meeting requirements now.

  - bugfix: deconstructing then reconstructing a Vehicle ASRS console will no longer
      replace it with a regular ASRS console
  - bugfix: attempting to give someone an item that is wielded will now properly unwield
      the item when trying to give it to them, rather than failing to do so and leaving
      an offhand object in your offhand.
  - rscdel: removed the ability of ghosts to observe peoples' inventories, pending
      refactor and fixing.
2022-07-05:
